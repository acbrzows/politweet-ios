The iOS app for PoliTweets leverages the javascript representation of the data that is represented in a web browser, and presents it in an easy to use, and modern interface. A C# application pulls a 1% random sample of all POTUS-hopefuls' Twitter mentions. Data is summed on a per second basis to get an idea of the current political tides by state. This is then displayed on a color-map of the United States which can be viewed on the web or the iOS app.\
